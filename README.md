## My AHK Scripts
This git-repository contains some windows AHK script that I use if and when I log-into my Windows machine.

## How to install?
The in this repository requires AHK software for running/compiling. Please download latest AHK from the [official website](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Once AHK is installed, just download .ahk scripts from repo and double click it to use it.

## Bind-keys: 
Below bind-keys will be readily available once you run the Bindkeys.ahk file.  For most bindkeys, I am using combination of Alt+key as I want to use Ctrl for vim bindkeys.

      Alt+r        : Reload Bindkeys.ahk script. Also useful to reset the execution for some reason.
      Alt+l        : Keep screen from being locked due to inactivity using subtle movements of mouse.
      Alt+s        : Take snapshot of active screen and save it with proper name in a pre-defined folder.
      Alt+p        : Using full page screen capture plugin of chrome, save PDF version of current web-page as it's displayed on chrome right now.
      Shift+Ctrl+v : Sends clipboard content through keyboard typing. Very useful for remote-screens when copy is not working fine.
      Shift        : Pressing shift will almost constrain mouse to a horizontal movement like it happens in ms-paint for all other applications
      Alt+a        : Reset Skype status - Available
      Alt+b        : Change Skype status to DND - Busy
      Alt+c        : Change Skype status to offline - Cut-off
      Alt+d        : Sends curent DATE in DDMMYYYY Format through keyboard.
      Alt+t        : Sends time and date stamp YYMMDDhhmmss through keyboard.
      Win+d        : For my personal use, converts some linux paths to windows mapping in my system
      Alt+i        : For my personal use, to download an online course for offline viewing by iterating over course pages.
